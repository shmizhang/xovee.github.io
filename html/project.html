<h3>UESTC-Course</h3>

<p>From May 2019 to present, self-motivated</p>

<p>
     <a href='https://github.com/Xovee/uestc-course' style='font-weight: bold;' target='_blank'>UESTC-Course</a> is a public resource repository on GitHub that contains review materials of courses of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). The course materials are arranged and uploaded by students of UESTC. Xovee is the main creator and maintainer of this repo.

    <summary>Background & Motivation</summary>
    <p>Every student in college, without a doubt, has to take a lot of courses and exams. Previously when I was an undergraduate student at UESTC, I prepare final course exams at the end of the semester. However, many times, I found many necessary course review materials are tough to obtain. On the one hand, examinees need to request materials from the students of higher class. On the other hand, examinees need to buy review materials from book stores (which are owned by third parties; these book stores collect review materials and test papers from students by paying them money every year; thus, they have the most comprehensive coverage of review materials of UESTC).</p>

    <p>In both conditions, students need a lot of effort and money to obtain the review materials which, might be crucial for a good test score. Some students may not afford the money cost. Some students may not have the connection, awareness, or experience to obtain the necessary review materials, which results in <b>injustice</b> when taking the examination.</p>

    <p>In May 2019, when I browsing the GitHub, I found a lot repos containing the course review materials for university students (e.g., <a href='https://github.com/USTC-Resource/USTC-Course' target='_blank'>USTC-Course</a>, <a href='https://github.com/lib-pku/libpku' target='_blank'>libpku</a>, and <a href='https://github.com/QSCTech/zju-icicles' target='_blank'>zju-icicles</a>). Motivated by these repos, I had an idea to create a similar repo in GitHub for UESTC students: an open-access and free platform to share and obtain course review materials. Then I discussed with my labmate, <a href='https://mortonwang.github.io' target='_blank'>Morton Wang</a>. We both think this would be a good idea, and then we started work on this project immediately. We designed the course index rule, repo directory organization, upload and arrangement rules, download method, copyright, so on and so forth. We initially uploaded the materials we possessed (most of them are computer-related courses), and then we invited others to share. </p>

    <p>Creating such a repo is not an easy thing. You need to market it, maintain it, enlarge it, make it easy to use. Students without computer backgrounds didn't know GitHub at all, and many of them can't access Github (or with a terrible speed) due to the GFW. The number of resources in this repo, although increasing, is at a languid pace. Anyway, we are proud of what we have done. We thank all the contributors. It is a great pleasure to see if this repo helped students when they were preparing for the exams.</p>
