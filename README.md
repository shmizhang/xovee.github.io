## Design Experience

Designing a website is really a challenging task, not the technical parts but the designs. 

It's just like a competition. Player A tells me to put many fancy functions and content on the page, but player B tells me you need to be concise and clear, don't put too much on the website, otherwise the visitor's attention would be distracted. 

As a result, I sometimes busying on adding features to my site, and the next day I delete them all. 

Anywhy, I perfer a simple design and control myself not to obey this rule. 

## Resue

If you want to use this template, please give me a star and add a link at the footer of your site, e.g.: 

```html
<footer>
  <small>Page designed by <a href='https://xovee.cn' target='_blank'>Xovee Xu</a>.</small>
</footer>
```

Just play the following files:

- `./index.html`
- `./css/style.css`
- `./html/*.html`

Thanks a million!
